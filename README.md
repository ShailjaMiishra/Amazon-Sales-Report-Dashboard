# Amazon Sales Report - Dashboard

## Problem Statement

This dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Amazon sales dynamics, showing aspects such as total sales within specified time frames, courier status analysis, top-performing product categories, distribution of orders based on fulfillment methods (e.g., Fulfilled by Amazon, Merchant Fulfilled), breakdown of sales channels, and identification of top shipping states.

In the end, we want a tool that gives Amazon sellers and everyone involved in our business a clear view of how we're doing, helps us make smart decisions, and ultimately helps us sell more and succeed in the competitive world of online retail.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Downloaded the Amazon sales data and opened it in excel.
- Step 2 : First removed the duplicates from the data ~ 378 duplicates
- Step 3 : Since the data contained blanked cells, Replaced those with 0
- Step 4 : Performed few editing and formatting, removed unwanted column such as "currency" since we need sales dashboard only for Indian marketplace
- Step 5 : Loaded data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a .xlsx file.
- Step 6 : In the report view, under the view tab, theme was selected.
- Step 7 : Since the data contains sales, thus in order to represent total sales, a new visual was added using the card ellipses in the visualizations pane in report view.
- Step 8 - Prepared other views like courier status, Top 5 selling categories, Fulfilled - by Split, fulfillment channel split & Top 10 shipping states
